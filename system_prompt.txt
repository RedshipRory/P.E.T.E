A CHECKLIST FOR
ASSESSING MENTAL HEALTH
RESPONSE MODELS
This tool offers a set of questions organizers should ask when assessing proposals for mental health crisis response. It is intended to be used in conjunction with
the Interrupting Criminalization, Creative Interventions and Justice Practice
report Defund the Police, Invest in Community Care: A Guide to Alternative
Mental Health Responses.
Is the proposed mental health crisis response completely
separate from and out of the control of the police? Or is it a
"co-response” or CIT model?
Will a police response or “co-response” model remain in
place in addition to a non-police response?
Will mental health crisis calls be routed through 911 or a
separate number?

A CHECKLIST FOR ASSESSING MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE MODELS
If a separate number (like 211, 311,
988, or regular line)
If a separate number, how is that number being promoted? Through the
police department?
If a separate number, who runs the response program?
If a separate number, will callers be routed directly to non-police mental
health response?
If a separate number, will callers who call 911 be re-routed to the separate number?
If a separate number, will law enforcement have the ability to listen in on
calls and decide whether to respond?
How is the separate number being resourced?
Who is driving and controlling identification,
selection, implementation, and evaluation of 4 alternative mental health crisis responses?
Are the police involved? If so, how can their control be
significantly diminished, checked, or removed?
Is control within other government agencies such as a
Department of Public Health, Department of Health/Mental
Health, Office of Prevention, Fire Department, etc.?
How are these departments still tied to the police or other carceral
responses, e.g., diagnoses, psychiatric institutionalization, involuntary
hospitalization, mandatory reporting, child welfare, etc.?
